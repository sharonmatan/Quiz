# Quiz

3th Assignment at Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp (Week 3).

In this assignment, I created my own version of an American quiz.
The quiz summarized all the user's answers and presented a short and tailored message to the user at the end of the questionnaire.

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

JavaScript
HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
